# Thoughts/Questions:
What is the difference between a stub and a mock? Book as this to say:
- The terms stubs and mocks are often used interchangeably, although they have slightly different behavior. A stub is a test double that returns values to the SUT. A mock is a test double that a test uses to verify that the SUT correctly invokes a dependency. Also, a mock is often a stub.
- How do we use mocks and stubs in Ironboard? Is there a pattern that we adhere to? Whats the difference between our approach and a library like mockito or the other mock frameworks mentioned? What are the advantages of such a framework?
